# 🛠 What you need to do:
✅ Replace:
- `your-username` ➔ your GitHub username
- `your-screenshot-link-here.com` ➔ screenshot links (after you upload the screenshots in GitHub repository)

# 🔥 Bonus Tip:
If you want, I can **also** help you create a clean **preview GIF** (live demo preview) that shows how the app works step-by-step 👀  
Want me to show you how to make that too?? 🚀✨  
(very good for GitHub, portfolios, resumes!)  
👉 Should I show that too? 🎥🌟
